# lint.conf — Per-file suppression rules for tools/lint.py.

# Format:
#   [suppress]
#   relative/path/to/file = rule-name-1, rule-name-2
#
# Rules can be exact (godot-native/parallel-state-cpp) or family-level
# (godot-native) to suppress all rules in that family for the file.

# Suppress only with justification: add a comment explaining WHY.

# rt_compositor_base.cpp includes gpu/ and accel/ from a modules/ file.
# This is a documented exception (see inline comments) — Phase 2 will
# refactor this dependency via IRayService::get_gpu_scene_data().
src/modules/graphics/rt_compositor_base.cpp = module/boundary

# thread_pool.h uses try/catch as a defensive safety net around worker lambdas.
# Without it, an exception in user-provided code would deadlock the pool
# (pending_chunks_ never reaches 0) and freeze the Godot editor.  This is the
# only file in the project permitted to use exceptions.  See the inline WHY
# comments at lines 110-114 and 199 in thread_pool.h.
src/dispatch/thread_pool.h = no-exceptions
