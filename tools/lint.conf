# RaySceneSetup is a PROGRAMMATIC SCENE BUILDER — it intentionally stores
# values locally and pushes them to Godot nodes via apply().  This is a
# convenience wrapper for demos and editor presets, not a data-flow violation.
# RayRenderer (the actual renderer) reads exclusively from scene nodes.
#
# The parallel-state warnings are acknowledged: RaySceneSetup is the ONE
# class permitted to hold these values because it OWNS the nodes it creates.
# If a contributor adds scene-state to any OTHER class, the linter will catch it.

# rt_graphics_demo uses RaySceneSetup intentionally — it showcases presets
# and runtime post-FX toggling (SSAO, glow) which require the apply() pattern.
# New demos should NOT follow this pattern; configure nodes directly instead.

# rt_compositor_base.cpp includes gpu/ and accel/ from a modules/ file.
# This is a documented exception (see inline comments) — Phase 2 will
# refactor this dependency via IRayService::get_gpu_scene_data().
